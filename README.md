# KerbalSynth
 Synthesizer for Kerbal Space Program
 This mod adds a customizable synthesizer block in Utility category. You can configure pitch, amplitude, tone, color and envelope in right-click menu.

# Dependencies
- [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-18x-110x-module-manager-414-july-7th-2020-locked-inside-edition/)
- [Indicator Lights](https://spacedock.info/mod/566/IndicatorLights) (Optional)

Note : If Indicator Lights is not installed, the note block will have the exactly same model as "The Not-Rockomax Micronode". If Indicator Lights is installed, then the note block will have a fancy glowing frame and adjustable color. So it's highly recommanded to install Indicator Lights.

# Custom Tones

 You can define harmonics to synthesize custom tones. see KerbalSynth/Tones/demo.cfg.
